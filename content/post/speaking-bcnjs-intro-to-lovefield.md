Last Thursday (1st of October of 2015), I gave a talk at <a href="http://barcelonajs.org/" target="_blank">__BarcelonaJS group__</a> about <a href="https://google.github.io/lovefield/" target="_blank">__Lovefield__, a cross-browser SQL-Like relation query engine; here I left the slides that I created for that purpose.
