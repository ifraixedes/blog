Tuesday (12th of January of 2016), at __{{<ext-link "BarcelonaJS Organisation" "http://barcelonajs.org/">}}__, I gave an introductory talk about __{{<ext-link "Generators Functions which are available in EcmaScript 2015" "http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-generatorfunction-objects">}}__ and __{{<ext-link "Async Functions which are defined in the draft proposal for EcmaScript 2016" "https://tc39.github.io/ecmascript-asyncawait/">}}__.

I wrote just these few slides

  <a href={{<ref "slides/bcnjs-201601.md" >}} target="_blank">See these slides in a single page & don't forget to press "p" to see a few notes which I've written</a>
</div>
<br>

and mostly I spent my time talking about them through examples which you can find {{<ext-link "in a public gist on my Github" "https://gist.github.com/ifraixedes/62a7155b87e7e7d0c71d">}}

If you were there, I hope that you enjoyed or at least got something good from my talk and please don't forget __to drop a few comments with your feedback__; it will be very valuable for me to keep improving.
