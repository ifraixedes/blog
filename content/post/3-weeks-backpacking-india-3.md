Train is the main transport that Indians use for long distances, is cheaper than others and they run frequently between main cities; hence it was one of the experiences that I wanted to live.

## Booking

Booking trains in India is a bit caothic, at least if you don't want to use the General Class (no air condition) which I heard was quite crowded and you will probably get tickets in the station for the same day; in my case I didn't want to use general class because I wanted to have some work with my laptop so I used AC (Air condition) Chair which you have more space and you have **sometimes sockets and less demand**, so more availability.

When you travel very long distances or in the night is worth to buy one of the options with berth, there are several classes; starting from the 3AC (3rd class AC), they have air condition and those are differentiated by less berths in the carriage, curtains, food, etc. I'm not going to explain each class, there are quite a few posts describing those thoroughfully.

You can go to the station to book tickets in advance or in main cities there are ticket offices that they sell tickets in foreign quota; I read about it but I never used because I preferred to do it online to save time, even though it forced me to take some trains in non-pleasant hours and have to plan a few days in advance. To be able to book online the best thing that I found was <a href="http://www.cleartrip.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cleartrip</a>, it offers a wrapper for the government website (IRCTC) but allow you to pay by non-Indian cards; again there are post telling about it, just bear in mind **to register in advance** before your travel because you will have to register with IRCTC which is explained by cleartrip but it's akward.

This is the only very long travel that I did, obviously I booked online, and I bought a 3AC which is the closes one to the inferior one (sleeper) but with sockets and air condition.


## The train

Note that my comments here are related with the class that I used (AC3).

Train was quite old and not maintained if we look to it from the West Europe point of view. I have to say that toilets are very dirty, smelly and you may thing that it isn't a toilet.

During the day people sit where the bottom berth lean when it isn't folded; middle berths are fold (they are around your head when you are sat) and upper berths are fix, so if you picked it you can always llay. These beds are dived by slots (kind of a compartment without door) of 6, 3 in one side and 3 in the other, each carrier have several of those; next to the slots are the windows and the corridor (no door) and just in front of them in the other side of the corridor there are 2 berths perpendiculars to the berths in the slot (they are call side berths), one bottom and one top, following the same that I mention with the 3 ones.

My recommendation is, if you can, to book a top berth in the slot, basically because you can llay whenever you want and **the sockets are in the slot, not in the sides**; I learnt that paying a very expensive bill, that I'll tell you later in this post.

There are, or somebody will bring, 2 sheets and 1 blanked for each berth; you will have to put them in the berth as they will be folded on top of the top berth.

## The journey

The journey started OK, people are quiet and you may find somebody that want to chat with you or is willing to do it; not everybody could do because some of them don't speak English to follow a conversation.

People in the train will offer food at the times of the main meals; I guess that if you order they will bring it to you at the time. On the other hand you will have a bunch of people going around selling tea (they call it chai), sweets, soft drinks, ice cream, some home food, etc. You can also go down to the stations meanwhile the train stop in those for 5, 10 or 15 minutes (depending of the station) and buy something in the kiosk which are in the platforms, some of them they have hot food (rice, Indian bread, etc).

Another thing to consider is that trains are a little bit bumpy some times, so it makes a bit hard to work with your laptop, but you can deal with it.

My journey was OK until, I put my phone to charge. I left it inside of a textil box that I used for it tight to the place to leave bottles of water. I put in a slot where it was a whole family, 1 man, 2 women and 3 children, I asked him for it when they were sleeping and he was still awake. After I laid in my berth which was the top in side next to that slot.

That was huge mistake, during the night, I was getting awake a few times and I could see the light of the charger there, so I was feeling OK with my phone. When the morning came, they got up before me and they were sat with everything pack; at that time I got up and I went for my phone, the charger was there and he was using, the bag was there but no the phone. I asked him and he told me I don't know, probably it dropped, something that it was impossible because it was inside of the bag and the bag was still there tiedd.

When that happens I looked around and I wanted to contact with the ticket checker but at that moment the train stopped in a station and they stand up to go out, I was in the middle of the corridor and I was asking him to get back my phone then he started to push me violently to go out; I didn't make an opposite force to avoid to get in troubles because my aim was to be able to check the situation with the ticket checker or the police.

At the end they went out and train ran away, so he lost the opportunity to demonstrate innoncense; my thoughts are that he took it just before I got up, thinking that I wasn't going to get up before their station, so I think that if I had got up 10 minutes before the phone had been there.

Anyway it happened and even though I am always very desconfiado I was beaten for been confiado so I am even more desconfiado now.

After that the office checker came, I reported and some Indian guys there helped me a lot with it; one of those, Rishi, I had already talked at the beginning of the journey.


## Arrival

When I arrived to Delhi, those guys went with me to the police station which was in the same station and helped me to make the report; for me was something that I had never expected as it took one hour something to finish all the process.

Moreover Rishi, who had to take a bus to go to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chendigar</a>, where he lives delayed his journey (bus) until late in the night to carry me in a place in Delhi where I could buy a new phone between different options besides to make the request in a Vodafone shop for a new SIM card.

We split our journey when he took a metro to reach the bus station and myself the one to go to my hotel.


## Conclusions

The experience to travel by train in India is something that I recommend to do if you travel to discover real India.

I also learnt that I cannot trust in anybody however it's tricky as those Indian guys helped me, spending a lot of time with me with nothing in exchange, so I'm torn.


I wanted to say thanks again to Rishi and the others for all the help.

Any question, clarification or whatsoever please drop a comment.
