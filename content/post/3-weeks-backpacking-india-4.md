After [my turbulent travel by train from Mumbai and going around in Delhi to buy a new phone](3-weeks-backpacking-india-3#the-journey), I reached my hotel in the evening.

Hotel was quite shitty, but for the price which I paid it isn't fair to rant and it was part of the experience.


## The night in the hotel

That evening I was quite busy setting up the minimum things that I needed in my phone; email accounts, Google maps, downloading ticket trains, etc.

The hassle to lose my phone wasn't only for the value of the devise, I lost a few pictures and all the videos which I didn't have the change to upload to the cloud and the Indian SIM card which [was a pain in the ass to get](3-weeks-backpacking-india-2) and to get it back a new one, with all the services which I had paid, took 3 days besides it'd be available in Delhi and I'd get back to Delhi 6 days later.

I used my phone to walk in the cities, that's important to find the places and know who to reach the places. Internet is good because was going to allow me to search for information, but mostly was to access to my email, tickets and Google maps.

Therefore I had to download everything that I needed, tickets, hotel bookings and maps to be able to access off-line; moreover I had to test how to go the following day to the embassy to report the issue and how to go to the station from the hotel in Delhi, and from the station to the hotel in Agra because the following day I was going to Agra in the afternoon.


## One day transition in Delhi

Before I had my train to Agra around 17:35h I wanted to go to the embassy on foot because I wanted to see the city and visit a few place on the way.

I did that and I'm glad of the result as I could visit a few places besides to report the issue to the embassy and stretched my legs after 25 hours stuck in a train.


## Train to Agra

My journey from Delhi to Agra was 5 hours and half so I bought a ticket in AC Chair class.

The train it was supposed to departure at 17.35h but it was delayed until 18:45, so I was stuck in the station for almost 2 hours; well, people had told me that happens frequently in India so I wasn't surprised and I think that it had to happen to have an experience real India.

The problem of that delay was that I will get on Agra by 23:20h, so it was more unpleasant time to walk from the station to the hotel.


## Reaching the hotel in Agra

When I arrived to the station you can imagine what happen, it was full of rickshaws and tuk-tuk (auto rickshaw) approaching me very tiring to get me to my hotel or whatever hotel which they may have commission.

I tried to avoid them, the hotel was supposed to be not far, so I can walk even though they are quite cheap for Western people; in Agra, as I had read, they are more tiring, but I felt that I got use and dealing with them and ignoring them had become easy.

To find the hotel was a nightmare, the Google Map point was wrong and it was close, it was in other street connected by a road; I was walking around the place that Google Maps showed for half an hour without success; I wanted to call them, but my UK line didn't have signal.

The place were full of <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">rickshaws</a> and <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tuck-tuck</a> which were approaching me constantly but none of them seemed to understand the name of the hotel until one of them did offered me to carry me for less than the minimum rate because it was close to there and I took.

At the beginning I was thinking that he didn't know and when were moving away from that in the road and after he took a street I was asking several times "are you sure? that you know where it is", he always replied "yes" and yes, he got it.

It was 1.15h, I wanted to check internet to reply some message that I may have received before going to sleep but they told me that no Wi-Fi in the room and only upstairs, even though they mentioned on Internet that there was Wi-Fi available. Therefore I took a shower and went to bed.


## Conclusions

Rickshaws can be useful to bring you to the place, you have to insist a lot where the place is and if you know that it's close, don't trust in them to know that it's far and you are wrong; if it's close and the want to carry you, **negotiate a fix price below the minimum rate** so you can make more sure that he knows where the place is.
