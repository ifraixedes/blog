After the recent news that{{<ext-link "NASA ending its DEIA (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility) programs" "https://www.outsmartmagazine.com/2025/01/nasa-dismantles-deia-programs/#:~:text=NASA%20has%20begun%20dismantling%20its,and%20inefficiency%20within%20government%20operations">}}, I'm stepping down as the local lead of NASA Space Apps Girona.

## Background

As part of my {{<ext-link "initiative to contribute and boost the Girona tech community" "https://silicongirona.github.io">}}, where in recent months, I actively organized and co-organized meetups, created a place where the entire tech and innovation community can meet, and endeavored to bring more value to Girona's community, I applied at the beginning of this year as the Girona local lead to host the {{<ext-link "NASA International Space Apps Challenge" "https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/">}}.

At the beginning of March, they wrote me an email accepting my candidacy.

The NASA International Space Apps Challenge is a global hackathon that has taken place since its inception in 2012.

## Reason to Apply

I considered the NASA International Space Apps Challenge an opportunity to organize a worldwide event that could bring value to the Girona community by creating interest and gathering participants in one place for two days to craft prototypes solving real issues humanity is currently facing on our planet.

I committed to leading it and making it happen in {{<ext-link "Girona" "https://osm.org/go/xUfZtF?relation=349023">}}.

## Reason to Step Down

After NASA's decision to shut down its DEIA program, I do not want to lead or contribute to organizing its International Space Apps Challenge.

I strongly believe that teams and events composed of a diverse variety of characteristics make the former stronger and the latter more enjoyable and rewarding for all participants.

My internal question is how I should organize an event with this code of conduct under the umbrella of an organization that has moved backward rather than forward in terms of DEIA. I see that it isn't possible because they are not aligned; if you know otherwise, please share it with me.

## Judging Decisions

I haven't written this to judge decisions.

Making decisions at the high level of an organization is challenging. In my opinion, it is impossible to make impactful decisions that satisfy everyone.

Some decisions directly impact people, but organizations have multiple goals, responsibilities, and stakeholders, and they must make decisions accordingly and in response to their current situation.

Is this NASA's decision good or bad? I don't know. Some people would say it is good for reason X, while others would say it is bad for reason Y; everyone has biases.

I'm certain that creating DEIA teams, organizations, and companies isn't an easy task. My thoughts are that we must try, try, try before giving up, because we need to move forward on this matter, not backward.
