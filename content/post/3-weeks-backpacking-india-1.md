This is the first post of a series that I'm going to write about my backpacking travel to India.

I haven't had lots of experience of backpacking than my first one which was last August (08/2015) when I traveled Western-Central Europe, so these posts are comments, notes, remembers and things which I've learnt on the way; I thing that some of them may be useful for people who wants to do a similar travel to India, but my first aim is telling friends and family my lived experience, than writing these series to give hints and tips because Internet is already full of them.

## Introduction

I visited a big part of the European countries with my family through organised travels, which are good to have a strict defined plan with comfortability at a good price, if you book in the right moment and spend a little bit time looking for deals; however with those you almost miss to meet locals and how they live; this is the main reason because I wanted to do that and not increase my bill too much or even decreasing it.

Why India? Fist of all India is one of the countries that I wanted to visit due the crazy stories that I've heard, secondly I bought a very cheap flight for last August (2015) after a fiend did the same and told me a bout the deal, but it ended it up in [a frustration](), so because I'd already got the VISA I decided to buy a new cheap one for October/November to make it happens before the VISA expired.

This travel wasn't about to have luxuries, I assigned to my self a tight budget as I did in the Western-Centra Europe travel, which cover the things which can make the travel more efficient, for example Internet access because I did some work through travel and I would avoid to spend time in queues or paying travel agents to book travel tickets. My aim was to walk into the place where the local are and see their living conditions and how hard is their lives and being xxripped to learn how to manage those situations, so use the theory in the real world and learn from the practice.


## Arriving

Before arriving I had to say that I have a long travel; my flight was from London to Istanbul and the flight from there to India was 21 hours later and I spent those hours in the Airport working remotely because I didn't want to have a second 12 hours visit on Istanbul therefore I considered better option to spend the time working in the airport.

When I reached Mumbai (India) was 4 something in the morning, after security and visa checks and get my backpack I sat in the airport to browser what cheap hostel/hotel options were around it because surprisingly there are a few.

I knew that India is cheap for Europeans and taxis, <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">tuk-tuk</a> have a miserable price in comparison with Europe, however what is miserable? prices that people have told you where from a few years ago so the things may have change a bit; As well know you can negotiate the price in advance but again, without a current reference it's difficult to see a higher price as cheat.

Due that I decided that I would walk to the hotel because it was 2-3 km away only.

When I went out of the airport as you can image you have **a few of dudes approaching you, telling you that they will carry you to a cheap hotel**; being honest is very attractive and thing that they will cheat you for that isn't fair, so you can do two things, give them a chance and if they cheat you bad luck, or forget about to play the lottery and ignore them and move on.

If you know me you may know what I did, I ignored them and spent my time walking.

Walking to the hotel not only I skipped them, I had the chance to get an introduction to a crowded Indian city and in the first main streets I've got approaches from the drivers in the road.

Lesson learnt, whenever I stop in a new place that it's usual place where tourist stop, I will move away from that to find a taxi; you may also be cheated but I think that it will be easy to negotiate than trying to do in those stops where you have a few drivers trying to get you.

## Conclusion

When you don't have any reference about the cost of the things, try to avoid as much as you can to deal with touts, or if you need try to ask different ones which are close but not one next to each other.

This is all for now.
Any question? drop me a comment.
