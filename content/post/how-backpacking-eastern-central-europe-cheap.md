After <a href="XXXX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BudgetAir fucked my travel to India</a> I had to arrange a new holidays travel for Easter-Central Europe at the style that I was planning to do for India, backpacking with a low budget.

Of course, the travel to India was planned to be a kind of fancy travel for a small budget due the Indian low living cost for a Western Europe citizen, however Central-Eastern Europe isn't that cheap as India
