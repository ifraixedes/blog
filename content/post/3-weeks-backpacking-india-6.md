After my [pretty bad experience in Agra](3-weeks-backpacking-india-5) a traveled to Jaipur, the Pink City, so this is how it went.

## Getting the Agra station

I took my train from Agra to Jaipur in a secondary station in Agra, my hotel was close to there (20 minutes walk).

In my walk I realised even more how Agra is quite rural city even though they have a lot of tourism due Taj Mahal, because my way to the station was partially in not illuminated streets and a little bit scary due the dogs hanging around ladrando.

I reached the station without any problem, took my train and nothing especial happened in the journey.

## Arrival to Jaipur

When I've arrived in Jaipur, around 9.45 hours, I saw a guy who was looking at me in side of the station, I thought that he was a tout and I tried to avoid to see if he paid the attention to other person; but he was in the way that I had to take so I had to go in that way and face with him.

As usual he was trying to help but I was saying that "I don't need anything, thanks" but he said that he only wanted to chat, so I said it's fine; he was kind and he told me that he didn't want to sell me anything. At the end we went out and he told that he is a rickshaw driver and if you don't need anything it's fine, but if you need a rickshaw during those days or anybody in the hostel, so we could share, I could call him and told me that he will carry us the whole day in Jaipur for 500 Rupees. This approach is not very usual and I was happy to take his phone number just in case but as you will have realised that my aim was trying to walk everywhere and only to use rickshaw or another metroplitant transport in especial situations.

I walked to the hostel (15 minutes) and when I got into I saw that, [Mustache hostel](), it was totally another concept from the hotels that I stayed.

After left my bags, I checked Internet to reply message loads maps, etc, because [last time it was almost 48 hours ago](3-weeks-backpacking-india-5#hotel).


## Visiting Raipur

When I finished everything that I had to do with Internet, around 12.30 hours, I went out to visit "Frote" which is a fort in a hill located in one side of the city.

As usual I was walking until there, sneaking in the narrow streets to reach a foot path which climb up to the hill. I took some nice panoramic pictures from the city and after went down to return back to the hostel.

However I took a look to the map and I decided to take another way to see a different part of the city and during that way I got into the Pink City besides to extend my way a little bit more to visit Central Park, which is unusual very clean by the way.

## hostel

When I was back from my walk, it was 17 hours, good time because it was the tea time; the served Indian tea (chai) with biscuits, and I realised that Indian tea is very tasty and I did like it a lot, something that I cannot say from English tea.

After that I was hanging around Internet, connecting with my family and talking with a few travelers and people who work in the hostel which are very friendly, something unusual in comparison where I had stayed before.

After I went to take a shower in so clean shower and went to bed.

Following day, I got up and I had a breakfast in the hostel, in the terrace that they have on the roof; it was a very nice way to start my day.

During my breakfast I was chatting with one Australiant guy and an Indian couple who was having a break in Jaipur.

Right after I went to the living are and I spent my whole day there chatting with Kirk (an USA lady) who is bootstrapping a business in India and USA and bunch other traveler from different places. I didn't go to anywhere as I realised that **I visited all the city in roughly 5 hours walking** the day before.

Following day I was going to Delhi for a day and my train was 6 hours, so I had to get up by 4.45.

## Conclusion

Been in Jaipur in Mustache I realised that there is cheap and nice places to stay as I had stayed in my Western-Central Europe backpacking travel.

I met a lot of people and they told me that India have this places and when I told them that I was going to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rishikesh</a> they told me the name of other one which is there and is very similar, so I learnt that <a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hostel Bookers</a> isn't good for India as I felt in Europe.
