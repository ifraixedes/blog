My stop in Agra was because even though I wasn't much interested in see <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Taj Mahal</a> the most of the people told me that you should visit if you are around Delhi region, so that's why I went to Agra.


## Hotel

When I got up in the morning after [I reached it the previous nigh](3-weeks-backpacking-india-4), I wanted to check Internet as the night before I didn't because the told me that Wi-Fi was available upstairs.

I asked them by the password and I went upstairs, but there was only a patio with doors to the rooms, so I had to sit on the floor; that wasn't a main issue, however Wi-Fi signal wasn't strong and my devices couldn't connect.

I complained about and they told me, "now it isn't working, it will work later", so you start to think that they were cheating me.

On the other hand, the hotel which was cheap, although I paid double because they didn't have rooms for a single person, was very shitty, this one I want to rant about it because my stay was embarrassing.

The room was quite dirty, I don't complain about old or quality, and maybe not to be the very clean, but that was so dirty. I swipe the table of the room with a white tissue and became black, the bathroom was disgusting, but not only the toilet and sink (in India not showers the same bathroom is a shower), the buckets which were supposed to take a shower because the pipe of the shower to drop the water over you was broken and there wasn't hot water.

Moreover, it is a restaurant and the door of the room was in the eating area, quite noisy if you want to sleep early around 21.30 as I did the second nigh, but also during the night and early in the morning around 4-5 hours they started to put music and make noise as in the middle of the day.

So it's terrible, a hotel can be cheap, but keep a few minimum things, [as Delhi one](3-weeks-backpacking-india-4), if not all a few at least, but this doesn't keep any, it was a totally piece of crap.

As I thought Internet never worked, I asked at least 7 times, during the day, and the last reply was that they are fixing the wires outside, so I knew at that time that they were cheating me in an embarrassing way.


## Taj Mahal

I went to Taj Mahal on my usual way, on foot.

I could see Agra through my way and started to confirm what people said, nothing than Taj Mahal and maybe 2 iconic places more.

I visited Taj Mahal as I knew they charge to foreigners at least 10 times more; moreover around the entry they are people around selling but **even worse the tourist guides which carry card and say that they are from the government tourist office** and show you the card to confirm it but they are selling you themselves or go to a shop to leave your bag than in the cloak mentioning at the same time showing you the card that the shop is from the government; totally pure bullshit with pardon of my French.

Being honest, Taj Mahal is fine to see but I didn't feel that it's great after I visited a lot of iconic places and it wasn't my main interest in this travel.


## End of the day

After Taj Mahal I didn't want to visit the other iconic places around as Agra Fort, so I was walking around, trying to find a place with Internet, I couldn't find any, if there are then are a few and I got back to my shitty hotel to rest because my train to go Jaipur was at 5.17h in the morning so I had to get up by 4h.


## Conclusions

If you don't have a main interest in see Taj Mahal, don't go to Agra, it's totally worthless, nothing to see and very full of tiring people trying to sell you things or services; in my case it was worse because I was in a very crappy hotel so I couldn't get anything good from it.

Any question?, please drop a comment.
