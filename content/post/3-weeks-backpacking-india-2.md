Obviously when I just reached the hotel and agreed with the price that I knew from Internet, I took a shower and got some 1.5 hours sleep; my travel was for 36 hours and Mumbai is very humid and hot, so you can imagine after [I walked until reaching it](3-weeks-backpacking-india-1#arriving).

## First day

After I got up from my nap I went to Mumbai central, however I went to the close rail station, Andheri, walking.

My walk, to the stations, was worth it to see the **suburbs of Mumbai, which are different from Mumbai which is more urbanised and ruled** (not as Europe or equivalent contries) in terms of traffic, sidewalks, etc.

At the same time I was learning the way to go and back from the station to the hotel and asking in shops which seemed to sell SIM cards. Having a mobile phone with Internet is one of the luxuries that I wanted to have basically because it helps me to search cheap accommodations with no cheating, move around, read information of the places and have a little work on wasted times (long journeys).

I got to find a shop which wanted to sell me a SIM, but I had to give a **photocopy of my passport, my VISA, two pictures of passport size and to sign everything besides a the form to fill**. I also had the address where I was staying, a phone number to contact with them. On top of it, I had to wait 48 hours for the verification.

After I got into the station; this is another cahotical place; **led panels show one or 2 letters which is the destination**, the time, 'S' or 'F' which means "Slow" (it stops in all the stations) and "Fast" (it stops only in main stations) and number that I didn't understand and I didn't needed to do it anyway.


## Second day

I did the same way to Andheri station, but this time I went to Mumbai C.S.T and I went back to the hotel from Churchgate.

This Mumbai part is more fancy, you can visit the <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gate of India</a> and the surroundings; I feel this part more monumental and Mumbai central more residential.

On the ways to go and back from hotel to the station I was asking for prices to the street merchants to have an idea of prices.


## Third day

With two days I was done of Mumbai, however I was going to be there until my 25 hours train to Delhi which was 4 days later.

During this day I was planning to work and define the places to visit from Delhi and booking tickets and hotels; booking long distance trains in India is another cahotic thing; they're very crowded partially because people book tickets in advance which release after but obviously as a tourist I didn't want to depend of a "wait list".

Moreover when you are backpacking and you don't want to depend that much of taxis, you have to take care the location of the stations, hotels and try to get the best departure and arrivals times.

However I had to solve another issue; the 48 hours gap time to activate my SIM card was done and the line didn't get signal; I had to go to the shop to solve the issue; the issue was really annoying; when Vodafone (the telecommunication company) called to the hotel to confirm that I was staying, the hotel said that they didn't know me, so moreover they made the things more complicated. At the end I could sort out, sending a new form with all the paperwork again and putting as a contact my Indian friend based in Bandra (Mumbai), but this time the activation took 7 hours and I don't know why the time was shorter, so they may cheat me the first time.


## The rest of the days in Mumbai

The fourth day I moved to a friend's flat who lives in Bandra; these days I could rest, hangout with them and finish my last bookings with their recommendations besides that they showed me Bandra, cooked Indian food and also carried me to eat Indian food.


## Conclusions

At the beginning I thought that I was going to waste my time in Mumbai that many days, however I don't feel that **I could learn how a few things work, which were quite important for my travel; moreover I could solve the problem with the mobile phone because if I had moved to other place I couldn't get it solved.

I think that those days were **worth to acclimatise which is quite important if you have to move around in your own without spoilingdd your wallet**.
