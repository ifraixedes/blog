This week I got my 5 favourite tweets of my twitter timeline almost the last two days; I've also been very busy this week, however I walked through in my timeline at the end of the each day and I've selected:

[io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) team is working very hard, the open governance applied to the project, one of the main reason they forked [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), seems that works quite well and they're moving forward pretty fast; this tweet talks itself about it

Quite amazing [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) open source project witch brings the ability to compile and execute c code in one go

I've discovered [parse5](http://inikulin.github.io/parse5/), an npm module released under [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) as well, which I considered that it looks interesting

One disclosed bug in OpenSSL always is quite interesting due the number of apps, systems, libraries, etc, which use it, however the versions with this issues are older than the version used by [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) production releases (0.12.0 and 0.10.36)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Are <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nodejs?src=hash">#nodejs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iojs?src=hash">#iojs</a> affected by the “FREAK Attack” OpenSSL vulnerability? <a href="http://t.co/DQi5sgDUev">http://t.co/DQi5sgDUev</a></p>&mdash; StrongLoop (@StrongLoop) <a href="https://twitter.com/StrongLoop/status/572900126890467328">March 3, 2015</a></blockquote>

And lastly I've selected a tweet which brought me to read a research experiment done by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/e); definitely, it deserves to have a read

And that's it of my part, have you got any interesting tweet that you'd like to share? drop it in a comment, I would like to read it.
