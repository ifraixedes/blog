This week, my first favourite tweet is not about tech, rare? where I have a few other interests as well, however don't worry, the next four are tech, so go ahead


Starting a business from scratch isn't probably the easiest thing to do, probably the opposite, so knowing from the experience of others is very valuable

[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) is getting my attention, so learning language features through blog post is quite passive to get into it

I love Internet, so I love the Web, reading about the new browser features is always in my todo list

I've been very happy of the new features that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) release, with the amount of package that it hosts, it was something that so many people were expecting, and happy they've got solve a hard problem

I think that this series of blog posts about ["Writing a Lexer and Parser in Go"](http://adampresley.com/2015/04/12/writing-a-lexer-and-parser-in-go-part-1.html) will very good, because they teach [golang](http://golang.org) based in a very familiar topic about computer science besides that the example is simple, so easy to step into, and based in a Rob Pike presentation.
